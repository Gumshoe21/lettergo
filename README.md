## Background

I always wanted to create a browser video game with flashy graphics and cool gameplay, but I figured it would probably be a good idea to first make a game that didn't require any kind of graphical rendering, was easy to plan and execute, and was simple to play. _LetterGo_ ended up challenging me to implement game logic and consider a lot of different edge-cases in that logic. Overall, I would consider this app to have been a great learning experience, and although the game is simple, I'm a firm believer that simplicity in games is often a virtue, not a fault.
